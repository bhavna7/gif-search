## Designed according to the following logic
1. Should search the gifs based on the query.
2. Should only search when the button is pressed.
3. Should render the gifs below the filters div.
4. Design should be responsive.
5. Should only show the number of gifs based on the counter.
6. Minus button should decrease 1 to the counter.
7. Plus button should increase 1 to the counter.
8. Counter minimum should be 1 if there are gifs, if there are no gifs the counter should be 0.
9. Counter maximum should be the total number of gifs.
